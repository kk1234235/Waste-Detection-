# Waste-Detection
This project focuses on developing an intelligent waste detection system using YOLOv8, a cutting-edge deep learning model for real-time object detection. The model is trained on a custom dataset defined in data.yaml, aiming to accurately identify and classify different types of garbage such as plastic, metal, and organic waste. Training was performed using the lightweight YOLOv8n model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 16 and an image resolution of 640×640, making it both efficient and scalable for real-world applications. The system employs advanced data augmentation techniques like RandAugment and mosaic to improve model robustness and generalization. All training configurations, including optimizer parameters, learning rate scheduling, and validation settings, are optimized for stable convergence and high accuracy. The trained model outputs precise bounding boxes and confidence scores, making it suitable for applications such as smart waste management, environmental monitoring, and recycling automation.
